# Daily LeetCode Practise
This repo is inspired by [haoel's GitHub repo](https://github.com/haoel/leetcode), documenting various solutions to the LeetCode problems attempted. 

I will be uploading new solutions for problems attempted on a daily basis as a commitment to improve my coding skills in 2021. 

Throughout the year, I will be tapping on additional resources to better understand algorithms and data structures in Python, coming from someone with no prior background. 

Additional resources such as [Data Structures & Algorithms in Python](https://www.amazon.sg/Structures-Algorithms-Python-Michael-Goodrich/dp/1118290275/ref=asc_df_1118290275/?tag=googleshoppin-22&linkCode=df0&hvadid=391842514726&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=16136343179200638546&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9062510&hvtargid=pla-455408937022&psc=1) 
and [Problem Solving with Algorithms and Data Structure using Python](https://runestone.academy/runestone/books/published/pythonds/index.html)
are widely cited as valuable resources during my research.
